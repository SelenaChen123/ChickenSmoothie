    to see incredibly generous people like you, so willing to help out
    and give, to spread happiness. Lovelies like you make me feel all
    warm and fuzzy inside.

    Hehe it's been my absolute dream ever since I started this game 6
    years ago to own a complete collection, and I'm so incredibly close
    now. Still a long ways to go, but I'm getting there!

    But anyways, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart
    for participating in this event. It's been a rough year, but it always
    warms my heart to see incredibly generous people like you, so
    willing to help out and give, to spread happiness. Lovelies like you

    [size=85][b]Oh my goodness, this is amazing! This definitely has to be one of
    the best holibombs I've ever gotten! You just gifted me an advent
    list out of nowhere?! I'm absolutely speechless right now...

    Ahhh I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this. It's been
    my absolute dream ever since I started Chicken Smoothie 5 years
    ago to own a complete pet collection, and I'm so incredibly close
    now. I've come so far! Aside from this month's outcomes, I'm just
    28 pets away from a complete non-list pet collection and 126 lists
    away from a complete collection in general. That's a total of 154
    pets! There's still a long way to go, but I'm getting there! Most of
    the pets that I still have left to collect are valuable lists, so this
    huge gift helps me out so much. I can't tell you enough how much
    I appreciate this. You just made my [strike]day[/strike] no, my entire week. ♥

    I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for participating
    in this event. It's been a rough year, but it always warms my heart
    to see incredibly generous people like you, so willing to help out

    [size=85][b]Oh my goodness, this is amazing! This definitely has to be one of
    the best holibombs I've ever gotten! You just gifted me a kitsune
    store pet out of nowhere?! I'm absolutely speechless right now...

    Ahhh I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this. It's been
    my absolute dream ever since I started Chicken Smoothie 6 years
    ago to own a complete pet collection, and I'm so incredibly close
    now. I've come so far! Aside from a handful of recent missing
    outcomes, I'm just 125 list pets away from a complete collection!
    I've still a long way to go, but I'm getting there! All of the pets that
    I still have left to collect are valuable lists, so this insanely huge
    gift helps me out so much. I can't tell you enough how much I
    appreciate this. ♥

    You're frickin' [i]amazing[/i]. I've known you for a while now, and
    in all of those years, you've always been so incredibly kind to me.
    I can't even begin to describe my gratitude...

    So once again, thank you so much for this, and happy holidays! ♥[/b][/size]

## Gift Wars

  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I don't participate in gift wars since I feel awkward forcing the other player to gift me. >o< I'd rather just gift on my own accord. Thanks for taking the time to offer starting a gift war, though. I hope you'll still accept just this little holibomb from me! Happy holidays and I hope you have a wonderful day today! ^u^
