[size=85][b]I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for participating
in this event. It's been a rough year, but it always warms my heart
to see incredibly generous people like you, so willing to help out
and give, to spread happiness. Lovelies like you make me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside.

Gahhhh this is why I'm so addicted to this site. Chicken Smoothie
is just such a magically wonderful place, full of amazing people
like you. You are what makes this place magical, ya know that?
Angels like you motivate me to better myself each and every day.

So once again, thank you so much for this, and happy holidays! ♥[/b][/size]

Hehe it's been my absolute dream ever since I started this game 6
years ago to own a complete collection, and I'm so incredibly close
now. Still a long ways to go, but I'm getting there!

But anyways, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart
for participating in this event. It's been a rough year, but it always
warms my heart to see incredibly generous people like you, so
willing to help out and give, to spread happiness. Lovelies like you
make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

[size=85][b]Oh my goodness, this is amazing! This definitely has to be one of
the best holibombs I've ever gotten! You just gifted me an advent
list out of nowhere?! I'm absolutely speechless right now...

Ahhh I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this. It's been
my absolute dream ever since I started Chicken Smoothie 5 years
ago to own a complete pet collection, and I'm so incredibly close
now. I've come so far! Aside from this month's outcomes, I'm just
28 pets away from a complete non-list pet collection and 126 lists
away from a complete collection in general. That's a total of 154
pets! There's still a long way to go, but I'm getting there! Most of
the pets that I still have left to collect are valuable lists, so this
huge gift helps me out so much. I can't tell you enough how much
I appreciate this. You just made my [strike]day[/strike] no, my entire week. ♥

[size=85][b]Oh my goodness, this is amazing! This definitely has to be one of
the best holibombs I've ever gotten! You just gifted me a kitsune
store pet out of nowhere?! I'm absolutely speechless right now...

Ahhh I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this. It's been
my absolute dream ever since I started Chicken Smoothie 6 years
ago to own a complete pet collection, and I'm so incredibly close
now. I've come so far! Aside from a handful of recent missing
outcomes, I'm just 125 list pets away from a complete collection!
I've still a long way to go, but I'm getting there! All of the pets that
I still have left to collect are valuable lists, so this insanely huge
gift helps me out so much. I can't tell you enough how much I
appreciate this. ♥

You're frickin' [i]amazing[/i]. I've known you for a while now, and
in all of those years, you've always been so incredibly kind to me.
I can't even begin to describe my gratitude...

So once again, thank you so much for this, and happy holidays! ♥[/b][/size]

[size=85][b]Oh my goodness, this is amazing! This definitely has to be one of

I'm absolutely speechless right now...

I'm sorry, but I don't participate in gift wars since I feel awkward forcing the other player to gift me. >o< I'd rather just gift on my own accord. Thanks for taking the time to offer starting a gift war, though. I hope you'll still accept just this little holibomb from me! Happy holidays and I hope you have a wonderful day today! ^u^
