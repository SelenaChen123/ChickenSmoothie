    [center]Hello dear~! ♥ 

    I just wanted to take a moment to give a little something to you as a token of my (and many others') appreciation for all of the wonderful things you've done to make everyone happy and smile.You're truly an exceptionally amazing person, I hope you know that. Thank you for everything you've done. You're amazingly kind, caring, giving, etc. etc. and I can't even begin to describe the gratitude we all feel for the fabulous acts of kindness that you've shown us. You're one of the many reasons why Chicken Smoothie is such a magically wonderful place, with a great community of wonderful people like you. Keep on keeping on, because you're beautiful and lovely just the way you are. Please, take this as a way of me saying "thank you" on behalf of all of the people you've made happy with the amazing things you've done.

    [size=200]You're absolutely [i]wonderful[/i], don't you ever forget that.[/size]

    I truly hope you have a fantastic day, night, week, month, year, etc. etc.! ❤[/center]

    [center]Oh my goodness, where do I even begin? Hmmm well then, first off, let's start off with introductions, shall we?

    [size=200]Hello, godlike! I'm ImThatRogue (that sounds weird), nice to meet you! (^u^)/[/size]

    Haha to be completely honest, I didn't even know you existed until a couple days ago, when I saw your name pop up on the Good Trade Thread. I check up on the Good Trade Thread frequently, you see. I just [i]love[/i] the amazing vibe that thread has. All the lovely people of this community gather there to give their thanks for the gifts that they've been so graciously given. Everyone is so sweet, so kind, so [i]adorable[/i], I just can't go a day without checking up on that thread. It just has a certain... feel to it. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, seeing everyone in this wonderful CS community come together to give their thanks and show their appreciation for people. It's just amazing. I don't know how else to describe it. It's just... [i]incredible[/i].

    So anyways, back to talking about how I came upon you. Like I mentioned before, I honestly didn't even know you existed until I came across your name on the Good Trade Thread a couple days back. I think I've seen your username here and there (you have a very nice, simple, unique username), but I didn't really take notice of you until a while back. Day by day, I was seeing your name getting mentioned more and more often. Everyone that you gifted was absolutely ecstatic with the gifts that you gave them. You've made so many people incredibly happy with your gifts. You're amazingly kind, caring, giving, thoughtful, generous, selfless, and just... I can't even begin to describe the gratitude everyone must feel for the fabulous acts of kindness that you've shown. You're one of the many reasons why Chicken Smoothie is such a magically wonderful place, ya know that?

    Gahhh this is why I'm addicted to this site. There are so many incredible people here, it's just... amazing (that seems to be the extent of my vocabulary now)... And you, you're one of ones on this site that I feel have made an impact on this site. You have no idea how much it means to everyone. Those gifts that you've given, those acts of kindness that you've done, they've all helped make CS the great place it is.

    This is nothing compared to what you’ve done, but I just wanted to take a moment to give a little something to you as a token of my (and many others') appreciation for all of the wonderful things you've done to make everyone happy and smile. You're truly an exceptionally amazing person, I hope you know that. Keep on keeping on, because you're beautiful and lovely just the way you are. Please, take this small gift as a way of me saying "thank you" on behalf of all of the people you've made happy with the amazing things you've done. I cannot thank you enough. Thank you for everything you've done. Really, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. [i]Thank you.[/i]

    [size=200]You're absolutely [i]wonderful[/i], don't you ever forget that.[/size]

    I truly hope you have a fantastic day, night, week, month, year, etc. etc.! ❤[/center]

        Ahhh I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this. It's been my absolute dream ever since I started Chicken Smoothie 6 years ago to own a complete TD pet collection, and I'm so incredibly close now. I've come so far!

It's been my absolute dream ever since I started this game 6 years ago to own a complete collection, and I'm so incredibly close now. I've come so far, I only have 125 list pets left for a complete pet collection! Still a long ways to go, but I'm getting there! All of the pets I'm missing now are super valuable lists, so getting this huge help is really amazing. ;u; With this incredible gift, I'm down to INSERTAMOUNTHERE away from completion AAAAAAAA! *o*

This gift genuinely made me tear up. ;-; <3 I adore this hoard SO much and this is just... amazing.

      I'm seriously practically in tears right now. Today has been a rather stressful day, and I log on to CS to see this... Your lovely message and incredible gift has made my heart skip a beat. You have no idea how happy, how.... what's the word? I don't even know, I'm just really, really, really, [i]really[/i] happy and grateful and emotional right now. ;u; Your words really have a huge effect on me. This act of kindness is much, much more meaningful than you may think. I dedicate a lot of my time now on this site to help people achieve their goals and help my dear friends achieve their dreamies, as they've selflessly helped me achieve my ultimate dreamies. I really do try my very best to make CS a fun, happy place for everyone, spreading the joy, spreading the love... It's wonderful people like you that never fail to make me cry and reassure me that everything I'm doing is actually making a difference, even if it may be small.

      Gahhh this is why I'm addicted to this site. There are so many incredible people here, it's just... amazing... Thank you for lifting my spirits and motivating me to keep on doing what I'm doing. Wonderful people like you are the reason why I'm even still here on this site and why I strive to be a better person and do what I do. I truly enjoy hosting these giveaways and interacting with all of you. I feel like I've been able to connect with hundreds and hundreds of people this way, and it's just... amazing. The internet is such a wonderful thing, wouldn't you agree?

      Aaaaaaah thank you [i]so[/i] much... ;u; Don't know how to end this... YOU'RE AWESOME. THANK YOU. HAVE A FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL AND FABULOUS LIFE, LOVE~! ❤[/center]

      Asfdklgfjdklmal;sdklfjkgjkdslsdkfjdsl;sdbjksnamskdjk legit I don't even know how to respond to this. I saw this gift the day you sent it back and I'm still in shock...

      Sorry I haven't had the time to sit down and respond to you properly til now! This week is crazy busy for me. It's the last week of class for us, so I've got a bunch of tests, final projects, assignments, research papers, and I'm volunteering all weekend at a science competition, not to mention I have to study for our final exams that start next week, so I've just been super exhausted. I don't think I've gotten more than 5 hours of sleep a night for the past month, I've been that stressed and busy. ;o;

      But even with my hectic life right now, you're just a ray of sunshine whenever I come online to CS. Haha I've been super busy with school lately, but I still have been coming back on CS more and more and procrastinating on all of the assignments I have to do to take a break. XD I feel like every time I come online, you're always here to kill me with your inanely kind gifts and helping me out so much with my DREAM goal of attaining every pet on CS. You've helped me out SO much and you seriously do not understand how much I FLIPPIN appreciate every part of your existence. Honest to god, words cannot properly describe HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU. <333 with all that's been going o in my hectic life, you're always there to bring a smile to my face, and I just... ;u; I love and appreciate you so much, Constellation, seriously. I'll say it a billion gazillion times, but it's never enough to fully convey how grateful I am to have an incredible person like you in my life.

      I know these angels are important to you and you love them, yet you just send one my way out of nowhere??? ASdlkkjavnsdkdskmal;sldkbjsa I really love the winged wood angel, too. It has a special meaning in my heart, since it's the first list pet I actually worked hard towards and I gifted it away to the person that recommended me to CS since it was her dreamie. I've always wanted to get one back, since I just love the design of the angel. It just has such a gentle, wholesome, and sweet aesthetic, and I love love love love that. <333

      Thank you SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOS much for this letting me take care of one of your beloved winged wood angels. ;u; <3333333

      I SWEAR TO ALL THE GODS THAT I WILL PAY YOU BACK TENFOLD ONE DAY. JUST YOU WAIT.
