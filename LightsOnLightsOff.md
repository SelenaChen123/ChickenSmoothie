    [list][b][u]Story:[/u][/b]
    [list]Selena was in her room, looking at herself in the mirror and
    adjusting her costume, making sure she looked perfect. Today was
    Halloween, and she was ready to go trick-or-treating! This would
    be her first year actually trick-or-treating, and she was bursting
    with excitement! She had always just given out treats at her house
    alongside her mom. Eager to go trick-or-treating, Selena made a
    few final adjustments to her vampire costume and then practically
    flew out of the door, leaving her brother running to catch up to her.

    Selena walked down the street of her neighborhood, looking for a
    house with their lights on. She didn't have to wander for long. One
    of the first houses she saw on her street with their lights on caught
    her eye immediately. The house was decked out with spooky lights
    and decorations. Selena turned into the walkway of the house, her
    brother following close behind. Walking on the path leading up to
    the front door, she noticed that there were jack-o-lanterns, scary
    dolls, skeletons, ghosts, and many other spooky decorations along
    the walkway. Just walking to the front door was getting her even
    more excited! After Selena finally made it to the front door, she
    rang the doorbell, smiled big, and shouted:

    TRICK OR TREAT![/list][/list]

    Oh my god, I'm shaking. I'm actually shaking and having trouble
    even typing this message out. I'm absolutely speechless. I really
    don't know what to say. This is just too amazing... I'm like...
    hyperventilating over here, you have no idea. I am just... in shock.

    Oh my god, where do I even begin? You drop this kind of bomb on

    [list][b]Haha but yeah, I hoard chickens. In the beginning, my goal was
    to collect 25k adult chickens to trade to someone to help a very
    dear friend of mine achieve a dreamie of theirs. But the user I
    was collecting the chickens for ended up becoming inactive, so
    I kept the chickens and now I just casually hoard them. Right
    now I have the largest chicken hoard on CS! And I think it's the
    second-largest hoard on CS in general!

    But this is awesome! This just made my [strike]day[/strike] no, my entire week. ♥
