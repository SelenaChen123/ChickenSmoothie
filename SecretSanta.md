      [list]Chicken Smoothie Secret Santas are members of the great and vast CS community who build up a collection of gifts for another user for Christmas. This annual holiday gifting event started back in 2011, almost 10 years ago! Thousands of Chicken Smoothie players have participated in this event over the years and have had a fantastic Christmas thanks to the generous players partaking in this event.

      Secret Santa is a popular holiday game/event where everyone gets to be a Secret Santa and is randomly assigned someone else to gift. You aren't allowed to tell anyone who you are gifting and you won't know who is going to gift you. The whole point of this game/event is to collect gifts for the person that you are a Secret Santa for and give it to them on Christmas.[/list]

      [list]Everyone should receive a PM from either me or one of the Little Elves with everything you need to know, including what tier you're in and who you're assigned to gift, within 24 hours. We all live in different time zones, so some people may get their PMs later than others. Bear with us, guys! We've got a lot of PMs to send out! Until all assignment PMs have been sent out, I can still try to work with the people who signed up late, so if there's anyone that hasn't gotten a form in yet, get your forms in ASAP! I'll stop accepting forms after all assignment PMs have been sent out.[/list]

      [list]Once registration closes, you will receive a Secret Santa and be assigned someone to be a Secret Santa for. Throughout the month of December, you will collect gifts for the person that you are a Secret Santa for and give it to them on Christmas.

      There are 3 tiers that you can sign up for: the Uncommon Tier, the Rare Tier, and the Very Rare Tier. You can sign up for any number of tiers, but if you sign up for multiple tiers, you will be randomly assigned to a tier once registration closes.

      You must provide a gift worth no less than the minimum of your tier. Your Santa will do the same for you. For example, if you sign up for the Rare Tier, the gift you send to your assigned person must contain at least 1 rare pet, along with uncommon, common very common, and OMG so common pets. You will also receive at least 1 rare pet, along with uncommon, common very common, and OMG so common pets from your Secret Santa. You can still send a gift with much more valuable pets, though!

      Here are the 3 tiers that you can sign up for:

      [b]Tier 1 - Uncommon Tier[/b]
      [list][*]You are only expected to gift uncommon, common very common, and OMG so common pets.
      [*]You may include rare, very rare, or OMG so rare pets in your gift, but you probably won't get any in return.[/list]

      [b]Tier 2 - Rare Tier[/b]
      [list][*]You are expected to gift at least 1 rare pet.
      [*]Your gift doesn't need to only include rare pets.
      [*]You may include very rare or OMG so rare pets in your gift, but you probably won't get any in return.[/list]

      [b]Tier 3 - Very Rare Tier[/b]
      [list][*]You are expected to gift at least 1 very rare or OMG so rare pet.
      [*]Your gift doesn't need to only include very rare or OMG so rare pets.[/list][/list]

      [quote][b]Are Secret Santas auto-accepted?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Yes, anyone can join as long as you completely fill out and post a form.[/list]

      [quote][b]When does registration close?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Once a registration deadline has been decided, I'll make an announcement and post it in the News section. Registration usually ends on November 30th though, so you guys have the month of December to collect gifts for your assigned person.[/list]

      [quote][b]How do I put my profile link and username in the form?[/b][/quote]
      [list][url=https://imgur.com/a/OfuHT]Here's[/url] a link to a little mini tutorial.[/list]

      [quote][b]Who do I gift?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Once registration closes, you will receive a PM from either me or one of the Little Elves with your randomly assigned person to gift.[/list]

      [quote][b]How am I assigned who to give a gift to?[/b][/quote]
      [list]First, everyone is split into their respective tiers. If someone signed up for multiple tiers, they're randomly assigned to one of the tiers they signed up for. Then within each tier, the list of all players in the tier is randomized. Finally, we assign people to gift the person below them on each randomized list. For example, for each tier, the first person on the list gifts the second person, the second person on the list gifts the third person, etc. until the last person on the list gifts the first person. This way, everyone is randomly assigned someone to gift within their tier and it's impossible to get a gift from the same person that you're gifting![/list]

      [quote][b]Can I be a Secret Santa for more than one user?[/b][/quote]
      [list]No, you can't. In order to keep everything fair, everyone will give one gift and get one gift. However, it's always up to you how many people you want to gift outside of this event![/list]

      [quote][b]When do I gift?[/b][/quote]
      [list]You can send your gift after midnight on Christmas day according to [url=https://www.chickensmoothie.com/time.php]CS time (UTC)[/url]. You'll have 24 hours after that to send out your gifts before the Elves and I start checking in with everyone, since we're all in different time zones and people may need to send out their gifts out according to their own schedules. If you know you can't send your gift exactly on Christmas day, contact me or one of the Little Elves in advance.[/list]

      [quote][b]How much do I give them?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Your gift must be worth at least the minimum of your tier. There is no maximum, though! Since you have the entire month of December up until Christmas day to collect gifts, I highly encourage everyone to go above and beyond to try and make your assigned person's Christmas extra special. If you're feeling super generous, you're even welcome to sign up for a lower tier but send gifts valued at a higher tier, knowing that you'll probably receive a gift of much lower value.[/list]

      [quote][b]Do I have to gift a dream pet?[/b][/quote]
      [list]No, you don't. You're only required to gift within your tier. Dream pets are usually are really expensive, so don't worry about it too much. If you're feeling super generous, you could definitely try, though.[/list]

      [quote][b]Does the gift have to be on their wishlist?[/b][/quote]
      [list]It doesn't have to be, but it's highly encouraged. People are more likely to keep what they get if it's on their wishlist. If they've written a Letter to Santa, check to see if there's anything else they'd like and just try your very best to make them happy![/list]

      [quote][b]Can I gift items, C$, art, or off-site items?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Yes, you can. But first, if they've written a Letter to Santa, check to see if they'll like getting items, C$, art, or off-site items.[/list]

      [quote][b]What if I don't know what they want?[/b][/quote]
      [list]First, check to see if they've written a Letter to Santa. If they haven't, you can PM either me or one of the Little Elves to ask them to write one for you.[/list]

      [quote][b]When the time comes, what do I say in my message?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Something along the lines of... "Hi ____, I was your Secret Santa! I hope you enjoy my gift!" Personalize it, make them feel awesome, and try to make their day![/list]

      [quote][b]What happens if someone doesn't give a gift?[/b][/quote]
      [list]I will contact them personally to ask about their situation and ask them to immediately gift whoever they were assigned to gift. It may just be because they forgot to gift it at the right time, they were busy, or some other justified reason. However, if they knowingly didn't gift the person they were assigned to gift, refuses to give a gift, and just takes the gift that was given to them by their Secret Santa, they will be banned from ever participating again. I will then personally gift whoever doesn't get a gift.[/list]

      [quote][b]Why does registration open so early?[/b][/quote]
      [list]I gather up as many Secret Santas as possible throughout the month of November so that PMs can be sent out with who everyone is assigned to gift and the event can officially begin on December 1st.This gives everyone the entire month of December up until Christmas day to gather gifts.[/list]

      [quote][b]Why is this not in the Free Adoptions forum?[/b][/quote]
      [list]The Free Adoptions forum is used for one person to give everyone else gifts, whereas in the Secret Santa event, multiple players give gifts to each other. This is an event based around a group of players, so the Clubs and armies forum is the best place for it.[/list]

      [quote][b]Are other gifting games like this allowed?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Normally, events where the creator isn't the only person giving away gifts aren't allowed. I get special permission every year to continue Secret Santa. The only other annual gifting games like this that are allowed are Lights On Lights Off for Halloween and Holibombs for Christmas, and they're run by some of the Chicken Smoothie staff.[/list]

    [center]Awww I'm sorry you didn't get to sign up in time! >o< I've already assigned everyone someone to gift, so I can't plug you in anywhere... I'm really sorry! ;-; There's always next year, at least! And Holibombs is going on now too. owo[/center]

    [center]Awww I'm sorry you didn't get to sign up in time! >o< With the way the Secret Santa event works, everyone is required to give a gift to someone, and is therefore guaranteed to receive a gift as well, so we shouldn't have any problems with someone not giving or getting a gift unless someone is banned or randomly becomes inactive during the event. But of course, if you're interested in gifting just for the sake of the wonderful Christmas spirit of gifting, I can promise you that anyone on the list of participants is absolutely wonderful and is definitely worth considering to gift! ^u^[/center]

      [center]Happy December, everyone! Sorry for the holdup! Registration closed on November 30th, but we waited a while for some people to fix their incomplete forms before finalizing things. But anyways, registration is over, everyone has been assigned someone to gift, and the Secret Santa event has officially started!

      [size=150]You have been randomly assigned to gift:[/size]

      [size=200][url=PROFILELINKHERE]usernamehere[/url][/size]

      So from now until Christmas (December 25th), gather up gifts for them! But make sure that you don't reveal that you are their Secret Santa until Christmas, when you give them their Christmas gift. If you know that you won't be able to give your gift on Christmas day, let me know and we'll figure something out. We encourage you to go all out and do your very best to give them a great Christmas present! Treat it as if you were giving your best friend, close family member, beloved partner, etc. the best Christmas present you could give. It should be personal to who you're assigned to gift. You want to try to make your assigned person as happy as can be when they find their Christmas gift from you.

      To help your Secret Santa figure out what you want for Christmas, we encourage you to keep your pet/item wishlists updated and write a "letter to Santa." A couple of years ago, someone started the trend of writing "letters to Santa" for CS Secret Santas to help their Secret Santa figure out what to get them for Christmas. Of course, you don't have to write a letter, but I highly, highly encourage you to write one to help your Secret Santa figure out what to get you for Christmas. In previous years, we've had you guys post your letters on the main thread, but this year, we've created [url=INSERTLINKHERE]Secret Santa's Letter Box[/url] for you guys to post your letters on. Post your letters on that thread, and keep an eye out on that thread to see if your assigned person has posted their letter!

      Also, we've noticed that people change their usernames a lot, and it can get really confusing on our end when trying to find you guys after you change your username. So if you change your username, please notify me as soon as possible so we can update your username on the thread and spreadsheet that we use to organize the event. It would help us out immensely.

      I will be checking in every once in a while via PM to make sure that everything's going well. If you have any questions, read the [url=INSERTLINKHERE]FAQ[/url] first to see if it'll answer your question(s). But of course, you're always free to PM me or any of the Little Elves to express any concerns or ask any questions. Keep us updated! We're here to help!

      Have fun and let's get this party started![/center]

      [center]Happy December! Registration is over, everyone has been assigned to a tier and assigned someone to gift, and the Secret Santa event has officially started!

      [size=150]You have been assigned to this tier:[/size]

      [size=200]Tier 1 - Uncommon Tier[/size]

      - You are only expected to gift uncommon, common very common, and OMG so common pets.
      - You may include rare, very rare, or OMG so rare pets in your gift, but you probably won't get any in return.

      [size=150]You have been randomly assigned to gift:[/size]

      So from now until Christmas (December 25th), gather up gifts for them! You must provide a gift worth no less than the minimum of your tier. There is no maximum, though! If you're feeling super generous and want to go all out, go ahead! But make sure that you don't reveal that you are their Secret Santa until Christmas, when you give them their Christmas gift.

Letters to Santa act exactly as they would in real life. They are Christmas wishlists addressed to your Secret Santa to help them figure out what you'd like for Christmas. You don’t have to write a Letter to Santa, but most people end up writing one either because their Secret Santa asked for one or they just want to specify what exactly they'd like to get for Christmas.

      [center]Hello! Just wanted to check in and send a PM asking how everything's going. I want to make sure that everyone's making progress with their gift-collecting.

      [b][u]Please reply to this PM and tell me about your progress so far.[/u][/b]

      If you're having trouble figuring out what to get your assigned person, make sure that you've checked [url=https://www.chickensmoothie.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=132489419#p132489419]Secret Santa's Letter Box[/url] for their "Letter to Santa." If you still aren't sure what to get them after reading it and looking at their wishlist, you can always PM me to ask me to act as a messenger and ask them what they'd like for Christmas for you.

      Also, I need to make sure that you'll be able to come online on Christmas ([url=http://www.chickensmoothie.com/time.php]CS Time[/url]) to give your gift(s) to your assigned person. If you aren't able to come online on Christmas, you'll have to either give them their gift on Christmas Eve. If you know you won't be online on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, you'll have to send me the gift, and I'll give it to your assigned person on Christmas in your stead, along with whatever message you'd like to go with the gift.

      [b][u]Please let me know when you'll be able to give your gift to your assigned person as well.[/u][/b]

      Oh, and don't forget to notify me if you change your username, so it can be updated on the threads and on our spreadsheet. This helps to avoid confusion.

      Keep on collecting those gifts! I'll be sending another PM in a week to check up on your progress again.

      Don't forget that you're always free to message me if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to help! Good luck and have fun! ♥[/center]

But it's insanely generous of you to try to get that for them. ;u; <3 I'm sure your assigned person be very happy with whatever you gift them since you've been doing your best to make them happy. <3 But you've still got a little while before Christmas, so keep on collecting!

    [center]Hello, everyone! Merry Christmas! ♥

    [size=150]It's Christmas now, according to [url=http://www.chickensmoothie.com/time.php]CS time[/url], so send out your gifts![/size]

    You have about 24 hours to gift whoever you were assigned. I'm going by CS time, since all of us live in different time zones. So you have until midnight on Christmas, CS time, to gift whoever you were assigned to.

    Don't forget to include a message with your gift! Say something along the lines of "Hi ____, I was a Secret Santa this Christmas, and this time I was yours! I hope you enjoy my gift!" Personalize your message, make them feel awesome, and try to make their day! It's Christmas, after all!

    As a message to all of you Secret Santas who may be worried about whether or not your gift was good enough: It doesn't matter if you weren't able to get their dream pet, if you're mostly giving hoard pets, or if you were only able to get a few wishlist pets of theirs; it's really the thought that counts. You've worked hard to try to get your assigned person something they'd like, and are giving it with kindness and love. As long as you've done your very best this past month to give your assigned person a wonderful Christmas gift, that's what really matters. Christmas should be about making your loved ones happy, after all. It's not all about getting amazing gifts. Plus, every single one of the Secret Santas is an absolute angel, so I'm sure whoever you were assigned to will accept your gift with a smile. After all, getting any Christmas gift at all is better than receiving nothing, right? We've all been through an incredibly rough time outside of Chicken Smoothie, so I hope you all can enjoy yourselves here and be proud of what you've been able to give this year!

    And to everyone getting gifted, don't forget to say thank you and be grateful for what you got. Even if you didn't get a major dreamie, your Secret Santa has been [strike]stalking you[/strike] collecting gifts for you for a month, doing their best to give you what they could and make your Christmas better. Don't forget to thank your Secret Santa for their hard work! They definitely deserve it.

    We've really enjoyed watching you all collect gifts. It's such an amazing thing to witness, seeing all of you do your best to give someone a gift and make their Christmas special. We're honored to be able to host this event for you guys every year. As always, if you have any questions/comments, you're always free to PM me or [url=https://www.chickensmoothie.com/Forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=703939]ImThatRogue[/url].

    [size=150]We'll send out one last PM in a couple days to make sure everyone got gifted![/size]

    If, for any reason, your Secret Santa doesn't gift you by midnight on Christmas, CS time, message me, and I'll figure things out. Otherwise, send out your gift and you're all set! You don't have to reply to this if you don't need to.

    [size=150]Merry Christmas, everyone! ♥[/size]

    I truly hope you have a wonderful day/night. Thank you all for participating in 2021's Secret Santa event. c:[/center]

      [center]Hello again, everyone! [strike]Last time I'm bothering you guys with a super long PM, I promise.[/strike] I wanted to send this message to finalize everything. I'll be checking off whether or not you gave and got a gift on my spreadsheet.

      [size=150][b]Please reply to this message ASAP and answer these questions:[/b][/size]

      [size=150][b]1. Did you get a gift from your Secret Santa?

      2. Did you give a gift to who you were assigned to?

      3. If you didn't give a gift, SEND IT NOW, and why?

      4. Would you like to be notified of next year's Secret Santa?[/b][/size]

      There are a couple of people that got banned/became inactive this December and I'm SO sorry if you were one of the ones affected by this! I mentioned in the FAQ of the thread that those who don't give their gifts will be banned, but I can't ban users that are already inactive. I'll just have to make note of who became inactive to prepare for next year's Secret Santa. Normally we send out a check-in PM during the event to make sure everything's still going well so we should've caught this earlier, but without going into too much detail, life got in the way of the Elves and me this year and we weren't able to send that mass check-in PM out. I'm really sorry! But regardless, I still hope you all enjoyed yourselves and were able to give/get something that made you smile! Goodness knows we need more kindness, love, and positivity more than ever this year.

      Any active users who didn't give a gift and just took their gift from their Secret Santa will be banned from participating in the future. Of course, that doesn't include the people that have given me reasonable explanations for why they couldn't give their gifts in time and have sorted all of that out with me. Those people are fine. Some people were preoccupied with stuff offline or simply forgot and didn't have any ill intent. That's totally understandable. But don't worry, I'll make sure that every single one of you gets the gift you deserve! If anyone doesn't get a gift from their Secret Santa for whatever reason, I'll personally send them a gift!

      As always, I really, really enjoyed hosting this event for you guys. Everyone single one of you has been absolutely wonderful. I've said this many, many times already, but [u]thank you[/u] for participating. Without you all participating and having fun in this event, it would've been nothing. It's thanks to you kind and generous souls that 2021's Secret Santa event was a success; you all made the holiday season 1000x more special. So thank you all SO much. I look forward to seeing you all participate next year! ♥[/center]

      [center]Hello again, everyone! I'm [i]so[/i] sorry this is a bit late, but I ran into some personal issues irl and I haven't had the time to really sit down, update the Secret Santa stuff, and send everyone this PM. But I finally took the time to update everything, so I can finally send this out.

      SO. Down to business. I wanted to send this message to hopefully finalize everything. I'll be checking off whether or not you gave and got a gift on my spreadsheet.

        [center] Marked you off on our spreadsheet now. Who was the person that gifted you on Christmas? It may have been your Secret Santa and they just forgot to explicitly mention that in their message. XD[/center]
        ```
      - 
        ```
        [center]Marked you off on our spreadsheet now. I'm SO sorry your Secret Santa didn't seem to give the best gift this year! I feel SO bad when some users' gifts aren't on par with some of the others, so I tried taking steps to help that sort of situation by implementing rarity tiers... The tier system we've been trying lately is supposed to help that sort of thing, but we made sure to emphasize that whatever tier you signed up for had minimum rarity requirements, rather than value requirements, since it's so hard to give definitive values for things lately. This way, generous users are able to spoil whoever they want, but at the same time, because the tiers are differentiated by rarity, there are always a few bad apples who seem to just do the bare minimum despite my encouragement [strike]pleas[/strike] to go all out if possible. ;n; I'm sososososo sorry about this! >o< I definitely take note of anyone who doesn't seem to attempt to get their assigned person something they'd like. But regardless, I still hope you had a lovely holiday season and I hope you can feel proud of yourself for participating in this event, giving someone a special gift, and making someone's Christmas. Cuz that's just a lovely feeling. <3[/center]

        [center]Marked you off on our spreadsheet now. But ahhhh I'm SO sorry that your assigned person became inactive! >o< It's partly my fault for not checking up with everyone more often to make sure everyone was active. ;-; I still hope you had a lovely holiday regardless! <333[/center]
        ```
      - 
        ```
        [center]Marked you off on our spreadsheet now. But ahhhh so sorry to make you wait for your assigned person to accept! >o< Could you wait a bit longer for them to accept? I understand it can get pretty busy and hectic around this time of year, so your assigned person may be preoccupied offline. Maybe give it another week or so, and if they still don't come online to accept, just cancel it. I'll continue trying to contact them in the meantime. Again, super sorry for all of this! >n<[/center]
        ```
        - 
          ```
          [center]Thanks for your patience while we try to contact your assigned person and figure out the situation. <3 Just in case your assigned person comes on soon, I'd say just keep the trade open with them for now. We've already sent a gift out to the person your assigned person was supposed to gift, no worries! c: Thanks for offering, though. We'll keep trying to contact your assigned person, and if they don't get back to us in a few days, you can cancel.[/center]

        [center]Marked you off on our spreadsheet now. If your assigned person hasn't accepted their gift after all this time, I think it's fine to cancel now. I'll make sure that their assigned person receives a gift. I'm so sorry about that!! >o< Thank you again for participating in 2021's Secret Santa event, and I hope to see you participating again next year! c:[/center]

        [center]Haha you're fine, you're fine!! I understand stuff like this happens sometimes and we can't really help it. I really, really appreciate you getting back to me asap, though! I've marked you off on our spreadsheet now. Thank you again for participating in 2021's Secret Santa event, and I hope to see you participating again next year! c:[/center]

## Messenger

  - 
    ```
    [center]Most people wait until they get their assignment PM to write their letter, since a lot of people sign up for multiple tiers and won't know which of the ones they chose is the one they got randomly assigned to, so they wait until they're officially assigned a tier. I'd give it at least a couple of days and if they haven't written a letter for you by then, send me a PM and I can ask them to write one for you. c:[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]I can PM them and ask them to write a letter to post in the Letter Box, or just ask them what they'd like for Christmas if you'd like! c:[/center]

## Re-Assignment

  - 
    ```
    [center]Yea, we've noticed that your assigned person hasn't been active for a bit now... We've sent them multiple follow-up PMs, hoping they'd come back and see it soon, but this weekend, we'll be sending out PMs to everyone again, checking up on you all and making sure you guys are still actively collecting gifts for your assigned person. If your assigned person still doesn't come back by then, we'll have to assume they're inactive and remove them from the event. We'll re-assign you to the person they were supposed to gift if that happens. So we're gonna wait a few more days to see if they'll come online, and if they don't, we'll re-assign you to someone else. I'm really sorry about this. >o<[/center]

## Haven't Received Gift

  - 
    ```
    [center]Aaaah I'm sorry, but please wait a little more. I know you must be anxious and excited to receive your gift, but your Secret Santa may have forgotten to come online today, or are preoccupied with Christmas offline. It's still Christmas in lots of places in the world (it's 7 PM here where I am). Don't worry, I'll make sure that you get a present! >u<[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Ahhh sorry about that! But don’t worry, we’ll make sure everyone gives and gets a gift. Christmas isn’t over in many parts of the world yet, so your Secret Santa may just be busy celebrating with their family in real life. So please wait a bit longer! If you still don't receive a gift by the end of the day tomorrow, message me, and I'll figure it out and personally send you a gift. <3[/center]

    [center]Aaaaaa Oddity I'm SO sorry your gift is arriving late! >o< Mannn... Manifesting a gifter that gifts on time for you in the future. XD But don't worry, I know your Secret Santa is definitely active this year at least, so they may just be preoccupied with Christmas offline. I'm sure your Secret Santa is just having a good time celebrating Christmas irl! c: I'll send out the final mass PM after Christmas day is officially over in every part of the world. I'll make sure you get a gift! And in the meantime, I still hope you had a lovely holiday regardless! <333[/center]
    ```
    - 
      ```
      [center]Haha no worries, I totally understand. It'll probably be tomorrow in your time, but I'll send out one final mass PM soon to ask if everyone gave and got a gift. If you still don't receive your gift by then, I'll bear down on your Secret Santa. But don't worry, I'm sure your Secret Santa is just having a good time celebrating Christmas irl! Things get pretty busy around this time of year, so I'm sure they just haven't found the time to come online yet. c:[/center]
      ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]I'm [i]so[/i] sorry you didn't receive a gift in time! You should've already received a gift by now. I'll send out a final mass PM soon to finalize everything and ask if everyone gave and got a gift, so I'll sort it out! Don't worry, I'll make sure you get a gift! (^u^)b[/center]
    ```

    [center]I'm [i]so[/i] sorry you didn't receive a gift in time! I'll be messaging your Secret Santa to sort things out. In the meantime, I'll be personally sending you a gift.

    incredibly generous people that this event is a success every year.
    I know 2020 has been a rough year for everyone I'm sure, but still,
    over 300 people came together to make Christmas special. That’s
    friggin’ [i]amazing[/i]. It’s really such a great thing to witness, seeing
    everyone so excited to give such generous gifts during this event.
    It's all incredibly sweet and heartwarming, really.

    You ought to take pride in being making someone else's Christmas
    special this holiday season. At the end of the day, that’s really all
    that these Secret Santa events are all about: making people happy
    during the holiday season. So I want to thank you, really, [i]thank you
    so much[/i] for being a 2020 Secret Santa. Happy new year! I truly
    hope that this year treats you well.

    [b]Thank you and have an amazing day/night! ♥[/b][/size][/list]

    Sorry this is super late, but I hope you'll accept this little late
    Christmas present from me!

    I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for
    being a Little Elf this year and helping me out with the Secret
    Santa event. It can get pretty overwhelming, doing everything
    on my own, so you really took a huge load off of my shoulders
    this year. I really can't thank you enough for it. You've done a
    spectacular job!

    I don't celebrate Christmas in real life, so I genuinely enjoy
    hosting this event. Seeing everyone get so excited about it,
    it's just... Gaaaaaaaah it's such a great feeling. Makes me all
    warm and fuzzy inside. Jesus, I'm so choked up right now!
    You know, it's a real privilege, me being able to experience
    Christmas online with the incredible CS community. You have
    no idea how much this all means to me... And I'm sure you've
    had a deep impact on some of the other users that participated
    this year as well. [i]Thank you[/i] for being a part of this Christmas
    miracle. I really do hope you had an amazing Christmas and
    enjoyed your gift from your Secret Santa.

    [b]Thank you so much for everything. ♥[/b][/left]

    [size=85]I'm so, [i]so[/i] sorry that your Secret Santa quit and gave
    you your gift so early! I'll give you a little Christmas
    present instead. I hope that you'll accept this little
    Christmas gift from me. c:

    I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for
    participating in this year’s Secret Santa event. I really,
    thoroughly enjoyed hosting this event. You should be
    proud of yourself, to be able to call yourself a 2020
    Secret Santa. It’s thanks to incredibly generous people
    like you that this event is a success every year. 2020
    has been a rough year for everyone I'm sure, but over
    300 people came together to make Christmas special.
    That’s friggin’ [i]amazing[/i]. It’s really such a great thing
    to witness, seeing everyone so anxious and excited to
    give gifts during this event. Makes me feel all warm
    and fuzzy inside. >u<

    You ought to be really proud of yourself, for making
    someone’s Christmas special this holiday season. After
    all, that’s what these Secret Santa events are all about:
    making people happy during the holiday season. So  I
    want to thank you, really, [i]thank you so much[/i] for being
    a 2020 Secret Santa. Happy holidays and I truly hope
    the rest of the year, and next year, treats you well.

    Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being a Little Elf (again)
    this year and helping me out with the Secret Santa event. It's a ton of
    work every year, so I seriously appreciate all of your help. As always,
    you've done an amazing job this year!

    I'm really sorry for being less active than usual this year. Not only was
    finals season tough, immediately once I came home after that, I found
    out that my beloved dad, who has been rehabilitating after beating nasal
    cancer 2 years ago, was diagnosed with cancer again. This time, he was
    diagnosed with bile duct cancer, a much rarer, more aggressive form. I
    found out about a week ago that he went into a coma and may not make
    it for much longer, so I immediately rushed to China to see him.

    Everything has been so stressful and depressing ever since, so I spend a lot
    of my free time here as a means of escaping from all that's going on and
    take my mind off of things. The amazing community that I've found here
    is just so kind and uplifting. Gahhh this is why I'm addicted to this site.
    There are so many incredible people here, seriously. It's awesome people
    like you, spreading the love and positivity, that makes this game one of
    my favorites. Thank you for all of your support this holiday season, helping
    me with the Secret Santa event, my absolute favorite event of the entire
    year. Wonderfully kind people like you are the reason why I'm even still
    here on this site and why I strive to be a better person.

    [b]Really, thank you so much for everything. ♥[/b][/left]

    [list][size=85]I hope you'll accept this little late present from me! I'm sorry this
    is so late. My boyfriend and his family got COVID-19 so I've been
    extremely busy and worried and haven't had time to come on and
    update everything...

    As always, I want to thank you for being a Little Elf this year and
    helping me out with Secret Santa. I know it's been a rough year
    for all of us, but you still took time out of your life to help me
    with Secret Santa again this year. You're always such a huge help,
    really. I can't thank you enough for it.

    [b]So as always, thank you so much for everything. ♥[/b][/size][/list]

## Positivity

  - 
    ```
    [center]Awww you're so sweet! Haha I always get so many messages like this asking to help out if someone doesn't end up getting a gift. The Elves and I always gather a gift for anyone that doesn't get a gift for whatever reason, but thanks so much for offering! <333[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Just keep on collecting, hun. Darling, I can promise you that whoever is receiving your gift will definitely, [i]definitely[/i] be grateful for whatever you give them. They're sure to understand that you've done your best this past month, doing what you can to make their Christmas special. And that's all that really matters. As long as you've done your absolute best, that's all that matters. It's not about getting the most rares or getting the best list pet or getting hundreds of wishlist pets for them, it's about doing your best to make your loved ones happy. I'm sure your assigned person will see that and be very happy with their gift. <3 But you've still got a little while before Christmas, so keep on collecting! [b]You got this![/b] (^u^)b[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    In the end, it's not about who gave more, it's about putting forth the effort to make your assigned person happy. If your assigned person was happy with the gift and you've done your best to give them something they'd like, that's all that really matters, right? c:
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Awww you're an absolute sweetheart. Honestly, it is a LOT of work, but seeing you guys so happy and having fun, it just makes everything totally worth it. I wouldn't trade what I do for the world. I genuinely enjoy hosting these things. I don't celebrate Christmas irl and I've always wanted to experience what Christmas was like, so I'm so happy to have the privilege of experiencing it with wonderful people like you on CS. Merry Christmas, love. <3[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Merry Christmas and thank [i]you[/i] for participating in 2018's Secret Santa! This event would be nothing without lovely users like you participating every year. <333[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Hehe I'm super glad to hear that! The more people that participate every year, the merrier! *u* My goal is to continue growing this event every year and have more people join next year! :D[/center]
    ```

## Negativity
    
### Incident 1

  - 
    ```
    [center]Hey, it's alright. I get it. I'm really sorry you feel disappointed with the gift you got from your Secret Santa this year. But keep in mind that your Secret Santa was a newer player, and getting even a few rares or older pets when you're new is friggin difficult. We've all been there at one point, I feel the struggle. But your Secret Santa has done their absolute best this entire month to try and find you some rarer and older pets, hoping you'd enjoy them. In the end, that's what this entire event is about, heck what Christmas is all about. It's not about getting the best gift or giving the best gift. Not at all. Doing your best to make your loved ones happy, that's what's really important. And you've certainly done that this holiday season. Watching you guys get so anxious and excited to give gifts and make your assigned person happy during this event, it's just such a precious and heartwarming thing to see. So even if you're a little disappointed with the gift you got, I hope you can understand that that your Secret Santa has done their best this past month, doing what they could to try and make their Christmas a little bit more special, and more importantly, I hope you can feel proud of yourself for participating in this event, giving someone a special gift, and making someone's Christmas. Cuz that's just a lovely feeling. <3[/center]
    ```

### Incident 2

  - 
    ```
    [center]I totally get it. Ahhh I understand how it can be frustrating or disappointing to not get a gift that's up to par with what you give if you give a huge gift, but that's just one of the risks of this game, even in real life. I do feel really bad when some users don't put in as much effort as others, but I really, really, [i]really[/i] don't want to implement any quotas or tiers or anything, since the whole point of this event is just to try and make someone's Christmas a little more special. If I were to implement any sort of quota or tier system, for example, newer players may not be able to participate or may only be able to gift each other, and that prevents any older players from nuking a newer player for Christmas and really make their day. I just don't want to implement things like that because I want for generous users to be able to spoil whoever they want, even if they don't expect the same amount back. Stuff like that is what this whole event is about. It's just about doing your best to give your assigned person something you think they'd like to make their holidays a little better, and to not focus so much on what you're getting in return.

    I will reprimand and take note of whoever doesn't seem to even attempt to get their assigned person something they'd like, though. What did your assigned person give you?[/center]
    ```
    - 
      ```
      [center]In response to your concern, I totally get it. I understand how it can be frustrating or disappointing to not get a gift that's up to par with what you give if you give a huge gift, but that's just one of the risks of this game, even in real life. I do feel really bad when some users' gifts aren't on par as some of the others, so I tried taking steps to help that sort of situation by implementing the tiers this year. However, we can't exactly specify an outlandish tier like that, since that sort of thing is very subjective. What one user considers to be an insane gift may not be as insane to another, so it's hard to make sure everyone gives and gets at the same level. The new tier system we're trying this year was supposed to help that a bit, but we made sure to emphasize that whatever tier you signed up for had minimum requirements, not a max. I want for generous users to be able to spoil whoever they want, but we can't expect the other party to give an insanely valuable gift way above the value of the tier as well. This event is just about doing your best to give your assigned person something you think they'd like to make their holidays a little better, and to not focus so much on what you're getting in return. I do reprimand and take note of everyone who doesn't seem to even attempt to get their assigned person something they'd like, though.[/center]
      ```
      - 
        ```
        [center]Could you send me the link to the gift? I'll confront them about it and see what's up. Again, I'm really sorry your gift wasn't on par with what you gave. It's just really, really hard on our end to regulate this sort of thing on our end and make sure that everyone gives and gets at roughly the same level. >o< We tried to remedy that this year with the tier levels, specifying minimum requirements for each tier, but it's hard for us to control everyone and make sure people aren't just giving the bare minimum. >n< We hoped at least that by emphasizing that the whole point of this game isn't to just give the bare minimum or give extravagant gifts, but try your best to give your assignment a good Christmas present that makes them a little happier during the holidays, but there's always people who are busy during the holidays and don't have time to actively search for their assignment's dreams every day or who simply didn't think they needed to put in that much effort and just wanted to casually gift. :/ Everyone does spectacularly for the most part, but there are always a few bad eggs I try my best to minimize. >o< I'll try to brainstorm more ideas for next year. Again I'm really, really sorry. <3 I hope you still had a wonderful holiday season regardless, and happy new year! ^u^[/center]
        ```

### Incident 3

  - 
    ```
    [center]Awww don't feel bad, you're totally fine and I know you didn't mean any harm by it. <3

    I completely understand why you're wary. That's specifically why I implemented this tier system a few years back, to try and make the gifting a little more fair so everyone can get a gift of closer value to what they're giving. It's really hard to definitively quantify the exact amounts that people should give in each tier, though. With the official "Rares List" gone now, the tiers are specified by plain rarity since "list" pets are much more loosely-defined nowadays.

    I know that in the main thread I make a note to the gifters that you're only required to gift the minimum of your tier but still highly encourage everyone to go above and beyond (usually that just means gifting tons of pets within the tier, but sometimes very generous users will gift well above the tier!), but when it comes to the giftees requesting gifts, I ask that everyone stay within their tier so as to not seem unfair or pressure the gifters to gift above their tier. This is a holiday gifting event, so in the spirit of giving, I think it's better to encourage people to give as much as they can, but not allow people to ask for too much, if that makes sense. >o< I had to put this rule in place years ago because you're right, some people would really fill their letters with a long list of their insanely valuable list dreamies and then just say one like that's like "I also like dogs" despite only being able to give pets of lower rarities. It was heartbreaking honestly. ;-; </3 So just to try to keep everything fair and in the spirit now, I encourage people to give as much as they can, but not allow people to ask for too much unless their Secret Santa has explicitly asked about their dream pets above the tier. I know a bunch of lovely, generous users always go CRAZY and give SO much (including valuable lists and such), but I still emphasize that that is in no way expected and it's completely up to the user to gift such valuable pets.

    But I can promise you, I've known your Secret Santa for years and they're an [i]absolute[/i] angel. >u< <333 They have plenty of fodder, but they just don't have much on your wishlist specifically right now so they've been scrambling to try to get more pets on your wishlist and were hoping to ask if there was anything else you'd like since they genuinely do want to make your day. ;u; I've been talking them back and forth to try and figure something out, so please bear with us! We really do want to work something out for you, so your Secret Santa is going to do their best this month, doing what they can to try and make your Christmas a little bit more special. <3[/center]
    ```
    - 
      ```
      [center]Aww you sweetheart I'm really glad I'm able to help make you feel better! <333 Broke my heart to see you all sad earlier. ;n; </3

      I hope you can understand that I really have to enforce that rule about not allowing people to ask for just valuables in order to keep it fair for everyone, but at the same time, I understand the struggle of going after a complete collection, so I promise you, don't worry, your Secret Santa is an absolute doll and is still gonna do their very best for ya. ^u^ I'll handle everything else so you can just have fun collecting gifts for your assigned person, k? Just enjoy yourself. c:[/center]
      ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Is this about this message that I sent?[/center]
    [quote="ImThatRogue"][center]Hello~ <3 It seems like you've really only mentioned extremely valuable list pets in your letter to Santa. While it's alright to mention these incredibly valuable pets, we'd like for your letter to include a wider range of options and not pressure your Santa into only giving you these high-value pets. ;-;[/center]
    [quote="ImThatRogue"][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/29ohMUi.png[/img][/center]

    [list][*][b]Don't ask for gifts above your tier level.[/b]
    [list]Remember that your Secret Santa is only required to gift within your tier value. Try to include a wide variety of wishes, both cheaper and more expensive, so that it's a lot easier for your Secret Santa to choose what to get you. This way you're more likely to get some things you want for Christmas. Also note that although it's fine to request valuable lists if you're in Tier 3, if you only put a few, really expensive things on your wishlist, it's highly unlikely that your Secret Santa can afford just those and you might end up with only 1 or 2 things for Christmas. Plus, Secret Santa is about the thought and effort that goes into getting a Christmas gift. It is absolutely not necessarily about knocking off a high-demand or hard-to-achieve dream pet off of your wishlist.[/list][/list][/quote]
    [center]Could you edit your letter to include more of a variety of things you'd like within your tier? Maybe specific species, colors, or themes you'd like? >o< Let me know once you've edited it. c:[/center][/quote]
    [center]I have to read through the letters that come into Secret Santa's Letter Box to make sure that everyone's letters follow the rules of the event, so I send that message out to anyone whose letter breaks one of the rules.

    I hope you can understand that I really have to enforce that rule about not allowing people to ask for just valuables in order to keep it fair for everyone. I know that in the main thread I make a note to the gifters that you're only required to gift the minimum of your tier but still highly encourage everyone to go above and beyond (usually that just means gifting tons of pets within the tier, but sometimes very generous users will gift well above the tier!), but when it comes to the giftees requesting gifts, I ask that everyone stay within their tier so as to not seem unfair or pressure the gifters to gift above their tier.

It was heartbreaking honestly. ;m; So just to try to keep everything fair and in the spirit now, I encourage people to give as much as they can, but not allow people to ask for too much unless their Secret Santa has explicitly asked about their dream pets above the tier. I know a bunch of lovely, generous users always go CRAZY and give SO much (including valuable lists and such), but I still emphasize that that is in no way expected and it's completely up to the user to gift such valuable pets.

    I always try my very best to follow the CS staff's way of sending out moderating messages, while still keeping my moderating messages as sweet as I can to gently remind users of the rules of the event since I don't wanna scare anyone away. But I'm really, really, [i]really[/i] sorry if I made your friend feel bad! ;-; </3 Please cheer them up for me? And if there's anything they need, please let them know they're absolutely free to reach out to me and I'll do my very best to work something out. I just want you all to have a good time and have a stress-free, fun holiday season. ;u;[/center]
    ```
    - 
      ```
      [center]In asking people to edit their letters, I don't ask that people remove their dreamies from their letters. If they're in Tier 3, they're free to mention their valuable dreamies, but I make a note in the rules that although it's fine to request valuable lists if you're in Tier 3, if they only put a few, really expensive things on your wishlist, it's highly unlikely that their Secret Santa can afford just those and they might end up with only 1 or 2 things for Christmas. Therefore, I always follow up and ask them to edit their letters to add in more specifics about anything else they'd like to help not only their Secret Santa out, but also try to make sure everyone gets something that'll make them happy for Christmas. Their letter only specifically mentioned true-date wishlist pets or URs, and while yes they did include after that that anything else was fine, I hope you can all understand that their Secret Santa would've wanted more specifics on anything else they'd like instead since those are highly expensive dreams. ;n;

      And I've already reassured Mew of this, but I've known their Secret Santa for years and they're an absolute angel. >u< <333 They have plenty of fodder, but they just didn't have much on their wishlist specifically right now, so they've been scrambling to try to get more pets on your wishlist and all they were hoping to ask is if there was anything else they'd like since they genuinely do want to make your day and not just give a few pets. ;u; I've been talking them back and forth to try and figure something out, so please bear with us! We really do want to work something out for Mew, so their Secret Santa is going to do their best this month, doing what they can to try and make their Christmas a little bit more special. <3[/center]
      ```

### Incident 4

  - 
    ```
    [center]I am... In absolute shock that this happened. Never in my 6 years of hosting this event has anyone done that before... o.o I am so so so so SO sorry this happened to you! </3 If they declined your gift for them, that's entirely their loss and we're not gonna make it up to them. Hmph I'm definitely gonna have to hound them down later and make sure they gave a gift at least. Thank you SO much for bringing this to my attention. I'll handle them, don't worry. And thank you so much for offering to send your gift to whoever still needs a gift too! I haven't sent out the final mass PM to ask if everyone gave and got a gift, but once I send out that final mass PM, would you still be down to be someone's backup Santa? In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed your gift from your Secret Santa and had a lovely Christmas! <333[/center]
    ```
    - 
      ```
      You're the best. I'll stay in touch! <333
      ```

## Withdrawing

  - 
    ```
    [center]Aww okay, no worries! If you're not comfortable giving this year, there's always the next! c: I still hope you have a lovely holiday season. <3[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Voltaire told me that you wanted to withdraw? If there any way at all I can convince you to continue participating?

    Quite honestly, it'll be a real pain if you drop out last minute like this... Everyone was assigned someone to gift and be gifted by, so if you were to drop out this late, we'd have to tell your Secret Santa to scrap the gift they prepared for you and come up with a last-minute gift for the person you were assigned to gift, which is really unfair to both your Secret Santa and your assigned person. ;n; Not only that, your Secret Santa recently contacted us and told us that they were going on vacation in another country, so they may not be online as much as they'd like, and already sent one of us the gift they were going to give you so that we could give it to you in their stead just in case they can't come online on Christmas. So if you drop out now, we might not be able to contact your Secret Santa to tell them that you dropped out last minute and that they need to prepare a last-minute gift for the person you were assigned to gift, which means that we will have to wait until your Secret Santa comes back from vacation to send back the gift that they sent us to give you, and your assigned person may not get a proper gift even though they've been working so hard to give someone else a gift. >o<

    Aaaaaaaaah all in all, it would be a huge inconvenience if you dropped out now, so is it possible for you to try to continue participating and gather up a gift for your assigned person? I'd really appreciate it if you could reply as soon as possible, since Christmas is just a few days away! Thanks. <3[/center]
    ```

## Little Elf Applications

  - 
    ```
    [center]I think we're good for now but thanks for offering!  I haven't opened up Elf applications for a few years now since the same Elves help out every year and we haven't needed any new help so far. :P[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]You're now one of the Little Elves! Thanks for joining! For now, there's not much to do but help spread the word, keep an eye on the threads and Discord, answer any questions people may have, and correct forms if there are any mistakes. Thanks SO much for volunteering to help out! I look forward to working with you! <3[/center]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [list]Hey guys! So I think I've waited long enough. I stopped accepting new forms last night, but decided to wait a little longer for people to fix incomplete forms. I plan on randomizing the list of participants once I get a reply from all of you so I know we're all on the same page.

    So here's how things go:

    [list]1. [strike]Registration ends.[/strike] [color=#008000][b]Done![/b][/color]

    2. [strike]Make sure all completely filled out forms have been accepted and are members are posted on the front page.[/strike] [color=#008000][b]Done![/b][/color]

    3. [strike]Make sure all the usernames/profile links on the front page are up-to-date.[/strike] [color=#008000][b]Done![/b][/color]

    4. Add everyone to the Secret Santa spreadsheet.

    5. Randomize the list of participants to assign who gifts who.

    [list][i]Person #1 gifts Person #2, Person #2 gifts Person #3, Person #3 gifts Person #4, and so on and so forth until the last person gifts Person #1[/i][/list]
    6. Put who's gifting who on the spreadsheet.

    7. Send out assignment PM's to every individual player.[/list]

    And here's where you guys come in! Firstly, are you okay giving me your email and knowing who everyone's gifting?[/list]
    ```
  - 
    ```
    [center]Before the event officially starts, the Little Elves help me out by "modding" the threads and Discord server, answering any questions people might have about the event, and making sure everyone's forms are filled out correctly. Once registration closes, we're all just here to help you with anything you guys need help with. We keep a huge spreadsheet to organize the event and keep track of everything. On that, we divide up all of the participants and are in charge of helping our subset of the participants so that I don't have to keep up with several hundred people alone. They also help send out the assignment PMs, check-in PMs, and Christmas PMs, following up whenever necessary.[/center]

    Hello! For the past five years, I've hosted a Secret Santa event in the Clubs and armies forum with staff approval.

    Secret Santa is a popular holiday game/event where everyone gets to be a "Secret Santa" and is randomly assigned someone that they will gift. The participants aren't allowed to tell anyone who they are gifting and they won't know who is going to gift them. The whole point of this game/event is to collect gifts for the person that you are a Secret Santa for and give it to them on Christmas. Hundreds of people participate in this event annually and have had fantastic holiday seasons because of it!

    I send a help request every year to make sure I still have staff approval to continue hosting the event, so I'm sending this again to ask for permission to start this year's Secret Santa event soon. It may seem a bit early to start thinking about the holiday season and Secret Santa already, since Christmas is still 2 months away, but we usually start on November 1st so we have enough time to gather up as many Secret Santas as possible and assign everyone to someone around late November/early December so they can start collecting gifts to give on Christmas.

    If you'd like links to the threads of previous years, I'd be happy to link you to them! I really do hope this event is allowed to continue, since it really is a wonderful tradition. Thank you!

    They're not actually participating in Secret Santa, so I'd like for this post to be removed. Thank you!

    Hello~ <3 Seems like your PMs are disabled, so I'm sending you a message this way. Could you please enable your PMs? They'll need to be enabled to participate in this event, since we'll send everything out via PM.
