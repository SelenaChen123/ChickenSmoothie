    Hello! Hopefully you don't mind me sending a suggestion to ask about this, but I didn't want to send a huge quantity offer without asking first. Would you perhaps be interested in trading a large quantity of rares up for my INSERTPETHERE? Thanks for your time! c:

    I’m sorry, but that would be unfair to me. >o< How’s this instead? c:

    I'm sorry, but this isn't quite what I'd like to get. >o< How’s this instead?
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but a few of the pets you offered on are currently pending in other trades. >o< Would you like to offer on just these?
    ```
  -

    I'm sorry, but I only trade items that I have duplicates of. >o< Would you like to offer on just these?

      Thanks for taking the time to send an offer, though. Hope you have a wonderful day today! ^u^

    I’m sorry, but I took a look at the pets in your open groups, and I don't believe you have enough for a fair trade up. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I’m sorry, but I value my pet higher. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I prefer my pet. >o<
    ```
    - 
      ```
      Every unlocked pet is technically available for trade for the right offer (except for the true date swaps only groups, those are just for actually just for true date swaps), but the pets in this group were gifts so I'm extremely picky with them. >o<

    ```
    I'm sorry, but this isn't quite what I'd like to get. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I'm really only looking to get pets on my wishlist, since I have everything else. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I’m sorry, but I'm not very interested in trading up my lists at the moment. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I’m sorry, but I'm not very interested in trading down my main lists to advent lists at the moment. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I'm not very interested in trading for that pet at the moment. I just have all list-valued pets on my wishlist in case I find them in the Pound or if someone is willing to trade them down for my non-lists. :P
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I'm not very interested in trading for items at the moment. I just have all missing items on my wishlist in case I find them in the Lost and Found. :P
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I’m sorry, but I’d rather not trade down my rare pets for non-rare pets. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I’m sorry, but I’d rather not trade off list. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but that pet is currently pending in another trade at the moment. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    Ah, I just got what I was trying to get. Regardless, thanks for your time! Hope you have a wonderful day today! ^u^

## NFT

    I’m sorry, but I’m only looking to buy list pets with my C$ at the moment. >o<

      Thanks for taking the time to send an offer, though. Hope you have a wonderful day today! ^u^

    ```
    I'm sorry, but I'm only looking to trade away my extras. >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but like the group name says, this isn't for trade. I'm only looking to swap it for its true date. Sorry! >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but like the names say, my malk smiles aren't for trade. I use them as place holders to help organize my groups. Sorry! >o<
    ```
  - 
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I won't be trading away any of these until I've gotten everything I can from the event. Sorry! >o<
    ```
