      [*][b]Do be polite.[/b]
      [list]You're asking for gifts from someone, so please don't be rude and demanding. Remember to say please and thank you to your hardworking Secret Santa![/list]
      [*][b]Don't say who you are a Secret Santa for.[/b]
      [list]Or else why would it be called Secret Santa?[/list]
      [*][b]Don't harass or be rude to other Santas.[/b]
      [list]Teasing, bullying, insults, or harassment will not be tolerated. If you have problems with another player, please contact me or one of the Little Elves.[/list]

      [*][b]Don't ask for gifts above your tier level.[/b]
      [list]Remember that your Secret Santa is only required to gift within your tier value. Try to include a wide variety of wishes, both cheaper and more expensive, so that it's a lot easier for your Secret Santa to choose what to get you. This way you're more likely to get some things you want for Christmas. Also note that although it's fine to request valuable lists if you're in Tier 3, if you only put a few, really expensive things on your wishlist, it's highly unlikely that your Secret Santa can afford just those and you might end up with only 1 or 2 things for Christmas. Plus, Secret Santa is about the thought and effort that goes into getting a Christmas gift. It is absolutely not necessarily about knocking off a high-demand or hard-to-achieve dream pet off of your wishlist.[/list][/list]

      [quote][b]What is a Letter to Santa?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Letters to Santa act exactly as they would in real life. They are Christmas wishlists addressed to your Secret Santa to help them figure out what you'd like for Christmas. You don’t have to write a Letter to Santa, but most people end up writing one either because their Secret Santa asked for one or they just want to specify what exactly they'd like to get for Christmas.[/list]

      [quote][b]When do I write my Letter to Santa?[/b][/quote]
      [list]If you signed up for just one tier, it's up to you if you want to start writing yours now or not. If you signed up for multiple tiers, please wait to see which tier you've been assigned to after registration closes before writing your letter. There’s no deadline to writing a letter, but it’s preferable that you write it by the first week of December so that your Secret Santa has a better idea of what you want.[/list]

      [quote][b]Can I ask for items, C$, art, or off-site items?[/b][/quote]
      [list]Yes, you can. These are great "stocking stuffers," but make sure that's not all that you're asking for. Try to include some pets that you'd like as well. If you're requesting art or off-site items, be aware that your Secret Santa may not be an artist or use other platforms.[/list]

    [center]Hello! I noticed that you signed up for the very rare tier, but I took a look at your pet collection and it seems like you only have a handful of very rares. Are you sure you'll be able to comfortably gift multiple very rares along with rares and pets of lower rarities? >o<[/center]

      [center]Sweet! Alright, if you're sure you're going to be able to [b]comfortably[/b] gift multiple very rares along with lower rarities, you're free to sign up for the very rare tier. c: Just edit your form to reflect the change and let me know once you've edited it so I can add you to the list. c:[/center]

    [center]Hello~ <3 It seems like you've mentioned a few very rares and OMG so rares in your letter to Santa but you signed up for the rare tier. While there's technically no maximum value to the gift that your Secret Santa may give you, they are only required to gift you within your tier value. We encourage everyone to give as much as they can, but we don't allow anyone to ask for more than they're giving, if that makes sense. ;-;

    [center]Hello~ <3 It seems like most of your letter to Santa is comprised of expensive list pets. While it's alright to mention some valuable dream pets, some of the Secret Santas may not be able to afford gifting such expensive pets, so we'd like for your letter to include a wider range of options as well. Not only does this help ensure that your Secret Santa isn't pressured into having to gift expensive list pets, but it also helps make sure that you'll get something you'll actually like![/center]

      [center]You're totally fine! I know you didn't mean any harm by it. <3 But awesome, thank you so much! ^u^[/center]

      [center]You're totally fine! I know you didn't mean any harm by it. <3 I know that in the main thread I make a note to the gifters that you're only required to gift the minimum of your tier but still highly encourage everyone to go above and beyond (usually that just means gifting tons of pets within the tier, but sometimes very generous users will gift well above the tier!), but when it comes to the giftees requesting gifts, I ask that everyone stay within their tier so as to not seem unfair or pressure the gifters to gift above their tier. Basically, I think it's better to encourage people to give as much as they can, but not allow people to ask for more than they're willing to give, if that makes sense. >o< I had to put this rule in place years ago because some people would fill their letters with a long list of their insanely valuable list dreamies and then just say one like that's like "I also like dogs" despite being in the uncommon or rare tier. ;u; So just to keep everything fair and in the spirit now, I encourage people to give as much as they can, but not allow people to ask for more than they're willing to give unless their Secret Santa has explicitly asked about their dream pets above the tier.[/center]
